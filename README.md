Multi30k Data Repository
--

### Getting ready

Along with the data files, we also provide:
  - subword-nmt as a GIT submodule
  - A recent (December 2017) snapshot of Moses preprocessing scripts

under [scripts/](scripts/) in order to minimize processing differences across
the users.

In order to fetch everything correctly, you need to clone the repository with `--recursive` flag:

```
$ git clone <git url> --recursive
```
